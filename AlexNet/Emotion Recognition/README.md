## Overview

Emotion recognition technology can be used to gain valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. By detecting how people react to certain products and visuals, companies can optimize their marketing strategies and improve their products. In this project, we will be using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called AlexNet for emotion recognition. Specifically, we will be training the network to classify images into two categories: happy and sad. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the emotional state of a person based on an image of their facial expression.

## Dataset

For this project, we collected our own dataset by searching the internet for images of people with happy or sad facial expressions. We manually filtered and labeled the images and organized them into two folders: train and validation. The train folder contains two thirds of the data and the validation folder contains the remaining one third. The images are both grayscale and colored.

## Results

We trained AlexNet on our custom dataset and achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set. Some example images and their predicted emotions are shown below:

## Applications

Emotion recognition has many potential applications in the field of commerce and advertising. By detecting how people react to certain products and visuals, companies can gain valuable insights into consumer preferences and behavior. For example, if a company is testing a new product or advertisement, they could use emotion recognition technology to see how people react to it. This information could be used to make improvements and optimize marketing strategies.

In addition, emotion recognition could also have economic implications. For example, it could be used to detect fraud by analyzing a person's facial expressions during a financial transaction. If the person appears nervous or anxious, this could be a sign of deception.
