# Emotion Recognition for Advertisements and Marketing

## Overview

Emotion recognition technology can be used to gain valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. By detecting how people react to certain products and visuals, companies can optimize their marketing strategies and improve their products. In this project, we will be using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called AlexNet for emotion recognition. Specifically, we will be training the network to classify images into two categories: happy and sad. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the emotional state of a person based on an image of their facial expression.

## Dataset

We will be using the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) for this project. This dataset consists of 35,887 grayscale images of size 48x48 pixels. Each image is labeled with one of seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, or neutral. We will only be using the happy and sad categories for this project.

## Results

We trained AlexNet on the FER2013 dataset using TensorFlow and achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. Some example images and their predicted emotions are shown below:

## Applications

Emotion recognition has many potential applications in the field of commerce and advertising. By detecting how people react to certain products and visuals, companies can gain valuable insights into consumer preferences and behavior. For example, if a company is testing a new product or advertisement, they could use emotion recognition technology to see how people react to it. This information could be used to make improvements and optimize marketing strategies.

In addition, emotion recognition could also have economic implications. For example, it could be used to detect fraud by analyzing a person's facial expressions during a financial transaction. If the person appears nervous or anxious, this could be a sign of deception.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you will need to install TensorFlow and the FER2013 dataset. You can find instructions for installing TensorFlow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and download the FER2013 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).

Once you have installed TensorFlow and downloaded the dataset, you can run the code using the `emotion_recognition.py` script. This script will train the AlexNet model on the FER2013 dataset and save the trained model to disk. You can then use the model to make predictions on new images.
